# Low-Resource-NER

### Overview ###
- In this project, we annotated named entities in 50 news articles in Northern SÃ¡mi, and trained a classifier to determine these values. The named entities used were PER, ORG, MISC, and LOC, and our annotation schema was based on CONLL NER guidelines. Because of the paucity of data, we used five-fold cross validation.
